For my refactor work, I aimed to streamline the code in the html file and css file. 

I aimed to fix any broken elements.

I aimed to provide edits to code, changing names like <div> to semantic tags like <nav>

In the CSS, I aimed to group similar together class elements that applied to more than one class.
